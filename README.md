How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  A user story helps to elaborate the user needs into simple statements, e.g., "As a <role> I want to <task> so that <reason/goal/benefit>".
  
  Then the Acceptance criteria helps to establish the scenarios that should be accomplished with the user story.
  
  It is imperative to have a user-cohort or proxy team to review the software periodically to make sure that the features are actually meeting the desired and stated goals.
  

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I tend to approach software design as iteratively as possible. Most people I have encountered need to have "something" tangible to make 
  intelligent decision, i.e., is this tool working right, should the button go here or there, do you like these colors, etc., and until they
  have something they can touch and manipulate (even if it's a non-functional mock-up) no decision can be made. Moreover, after seeing these realizations 
  opinions can change and this should not be taken as a negative.
  
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  I think being a good team member in software is the same as being a member of any team. Basically, the willingness to try, be truthful and open.
  There are many tasks in software and not all are glamorous or even fully understood but still must be accomplished. For the times I am unsure of how to implement
  something, because it's new or just foreign, I try to be open with the team and ask for help. Maybe there is an established design pattern or even an available
   library.
